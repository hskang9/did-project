The module has 6 dispatchable functions. Each function goes through the example with bob and alice.

## request

inputs:

- `origin`: sender of the extrinsic
- `lender`: lender address to owe
- `amount`: amount of balance that the lender will transfer without regarding the extrinsic fee
- `expires_at`: The date in blocknumber that the borrower will pay the debt
- `interest`: interest rate in precision of 1000(e.g. if the argument is 10 then 10/1000 = 1/100(1%))
- `collateral`: amount of balance to transfer to the lender when borrower fails to pay debt
- `period`: period which the bond will activate

event:
`LoanRequested` is emitted with

- `Lender`: The lender address that the borrower requests to
- `Borrower`: The borrower's address
- `H256`: the bond id generated from request extrinsic

## approve

inputs:

- `bond_id`: H256 hash that the request has sent to approver

what it does:
approver approves the bond and bond activates

** Activation ** 

Activated bonds sets future operation to increment the loan amount with interest rate.

The amount is increased with `(1+ {the_interest_rate})*amount`.

event:
`LoanApproved` is emitted with

- `Lender`: The approver address
- `Borrower`: The borrower address
- `Time`: the time the bond is activated as block height


## redeem

inputs:
- `bond_id`: H256 hash for bond id

what it does: 
Borrower removes the bond by paying the debt back to the lender

event:
`LoanRedeemed` is emitted with

- `Lender`: The lender
- `Borrower`: The borrower
- `Redeemed`: the amount of balance that the borrower paid back to the lender including interest

## repossess

event:
`LoanRepossessed` is emitted with

- `Lender`: the lender who reposesses the amount of balance
- `Borrower`: the borrower who failed to pay the debt back
- `Price`: the amount of collateral balance

## sell_bond

inputs:
- `bond_id`: H256 hash for bond id
- `price`: price to set the bond for sale

what it does:
lender sets the bond for sale on given price

event:
`BondTransferRequested` is emitted with

- `H256`: bond id hash
- `Lender`: the owner of the bond 
- `Price`: the price of the bond for sale

## buy_bond

inputs:
- `bond_id`: H256 hash for bond id

what it does:
the buyer buys the bond with the price specified for sale.
Then, the lender is switched in the bond.

event:
`BondTransferApproved` is emitted with

- `H256`: bond id hash
- `Lender`: new lender for the bond
